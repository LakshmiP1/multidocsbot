1. Model accuracy is not of great importance in imbalanced datasets. In those cases, we look at other performance metrics like sensitivity, specificity , f1-score etc.

2. Spam detection, stock market crash are examples where false positives are important.
 
Reason being, its more problematic when model says your email is a spam but in reality its not. So you will miss out on an imp one. 

Also, stock market crash, where the model predicted that the market is not gonna crash, 
investor invests in loads of money but it actually crashes and then the investor looses all of the money invested.

False negative in stock market crash is a lost opportunity.

3. Examples where False negative is important are healthcare and risk compliance/sanction models.
 When model says the person doesn't have cancer, but in reality the person has cancer. So the person will miss out on imp medications. 
Also, risk models like customer risk ranking model, where the model predicts the customer to be non-risky but actually the customer is risky. 
And the consequence being, the bank allows such customers to do business with them and end up in a mess where they perform suspicious activity like money laundering.
